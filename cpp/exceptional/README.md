# Exceptional C++

Here I collect exercise solutions from Exceptional C++ book by Herb
Sutter. Most of the solutions is from the book and I don't trying to
answer every question here or provide all answers from the book. So I
bring them here just to play around with solutions and see how it
works/compiles.
